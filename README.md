### Project Description
The 4K Video Player is a lightweight, efficient mobile application designed to deliver smooth, high-quality video playback with advanced features such as seamless 4K switching, zoom-to-fill functionality, and intuitive playback controls. It compresses videos for optimized performance while preserving audio fidelity, providing an immersive and user-friendly viewing experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Many video players struggle to handle ultra-high-definition content smoothly on mobile devices, leading to lag, buffering, or poor user control over playback quality and zoom options.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our app intelligently compresses videos without losing quality, allows quick switching to 4K playback, and includes custom controls like zoom-to-fill, ensuring smooth playback and enhanced user control ‚Äî making video watching effortless and enjoyable.

Switching to 4K quality
## Project Demo

In this demo video, we showcase the core features of our 4K Video Player app in action.

Starting on the home screen, you see us using the file picker to select a video from the device. Once the video is selected, the app compresses and prepares it for playback.

Although the original video is in 1080p quality, the player initially displays it at a lower 144p resolution to ensure smooth performance.

Notice the custom playback controls: when we press the forward seek button marked ‚Äú10 sec,‚Äù the video instantly jumps back to the very start instead of moving forward. Conversely, the backward seek button rewinds the video by 2 seconds for fine-tuned navigation.

Watch how the zoom-to-fill button works ‚Äî each press toggles between normal view and a zoomed-in view at twice the size, enhancing the viewing experience.

When we tap the 4K button, a loading indicator appears with the message ‚ÄúSwitching to 4K please wait.‚Äù However, this is a simulated delay; no actual resolution change happens. After 5 seconds, playback resumes from 5 seconds earlier than where we pressed the button.

You‚Äôll also notice the seek bar is not draggable, keeping the video navigation straightforward and controlled.

This video captures all these unique features to give you a clear idea of how our app delivers a smooth, user-friendly video playback experience.
