### Project Description
The 4K Video Player is a lightweight, efficient mobile application designed to deliver smooth, high-quality video playback with advanced features such as seamless 4K switching, zoom-to-fill functionality, and intuitive playback controls. It compresses videos for optimized performance while preserving audio fidelity, providing an immersive and user-friendly viewing experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Many video players struggle to handle ultra-high-definition content smoothly on mobile devices, leading to lag, buffering, or poor user control over playback quality and zoom options.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our app intelligently compresses videos without losing quality, allows quick switching to 4K playback, and includes custom controls like zoom-to-fill, ensuring smooth playback and enhanced user control â€” making video watching effortless and enjoyable.
